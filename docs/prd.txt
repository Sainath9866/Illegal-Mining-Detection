ou are helping me build a Smart India Hackathon project: Detection of Illegal Open-Crust Mining Activity using Satellite Images and DEM.
I need you to guide me step by step and generate code wherever possible. The system should:

Download and preprocess satellite data (EO/SAR + DEM).

Detect mining areas (legal + illegal) using rule-based indices and optionally ML segmentation.

Compare with mining boundary shapefile (KML/SHP) to identify illegal mining activity.

Estimate depth and volume of mined area using DEM differences (Simpson’s rule).

Provide 2D and 3D visualization of the mining site.

Generate automatic reports with stats, maps, and figures.

🔹 Step 1: Dataset Acquisition

Use Sentinel-2 imagery (10m resolution multispectral) for land cover and mining detection.

Use Sentinel-1 SAR (optional, for robustness in cloudy conditions).

Use SRTM DEM (30m) or ALOS PALSAR DEM (12.5m) for elevation.

Use boundary shapefiles: mining lease areas (KML/SHP), and district boundaries of India (GADM or NIC).

Code should demonstrate downloading these datasets using:

Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API (ee)

Or sentinelsat for Sentinel data

Or direct download + local preprocessing with GDAL/Rasterio.

🔹 Step 2: Preprocessing

Reproject everything to EPSG:4326.

Clip images to district or mining AoI boundary.

Normalize spectral bands (B2, B3, B4, B8, B11, B12).

Preprocess DEM: fill voids, smooth, align with imagery.

Use Python libraries:

rasterio, geopandas, shapely, gdal, numpy, matplotlib.

🔹 Step 3: Mining Area Detection

Implement two approaches:

A. Rule-based detection (fast MVP):

Compute NDVI = (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red).

Compute BSI = ((SWIR + Red) – (NIR + Blue)) / ((SWIR + Red) + (NIR + Blue)).

Thresholds:

NDVI < 0.2 → non-vegetated.

BSI > 0.3 → bare soil (likely mining).

Generate binary mask of mining vs non-mining.

B. ML-based (advanced, optional):

Use U-Net / DeepLabV3 segmentation model with Sentinel-2 bands as input.

Classes: {0: Non-mining, 1: Mining}.

Train with annotated mining polygons (if available).

Fine-tune pre-trained land cover models for efficiency.

🔹 Step 4: Illegal Mining Detection

Input: mining lease boundary shapefile (KML/SHP).

Overlay detected mining polygons with lease boundary.

Use spatial difference:

Inside boundary = legal mining.

Outside boundary = illegal mining.

Use geopandas.overlay() or shapely.difference() to compute illegal area polygons.

Calculate area (polygon.area in sq. meters → hectares).

🔹 Step 5: Mining Depth & Volume Estimation

From DEM: calculate elevation difference (pre-mining vs post-mining DEM).

For single DEM (current state): compute depth relative to surrounding undisturbed land.

Volume Estimation:

Apply Simpson’s Rule (approximation of 3D volume):

𝑉

Volume=∑Depth

	​

×Area

Code should output:

Average mining depth (m).

Total volume extracted (m³).

🔹 Step 6: Visualization

2D Visualization:

Use folium or leaflet.js in Python/Jupyter or web frontend.

Layers: satellite imagery, lease boundary, detected mining, illegal mining.

3D Visualization:

From DEM → generate surface model with pyvista, matplotlib 3D, or plotly.

Web frontend: use CesiumJS or kepler.gl for interactive 3D.

Overlay mining polygons on terrain model.

🔹 Step 7: Report Generation

Auto-generate PDF with:

Mining area inside lease (ha).

Illegal mining area (ha).

Mining depth (m).

Mining volume (m³).

Maps & 3D snapshots.

Tools:

reportlab or fpdf in Python.

Or generate HTML with jinja2 → convert to PDF with weasyprint.

🔹 Step 8: Full Architecture

Backend (Python + FastAPI):

Preprocessing, detection, DEM analysis, report generation.

Frontend (React + Leaflet.js + CesiumJS):

Upload shapefile, visualize mining maps, show illegal areas, interactive 3D viewer.

Database (optional):

PostGIS / SQLite for storing mining polygons & reports.

📌 Deliverables for Hackathon

Working prototype that:

Loads satellite + DEM data.

Detects mining vs non-mining.

Identifies illegal mining outside boundaries.

Shows mining areas in 2D/3D maps.

Generates a report PDF automatically.

Stretch goal: ML-based segmentation with pretrained U-Net for more accuracy.

👉 Now, step by step, generate me Python code modules and explanations for each stage:

(1) Dataset download + preprocessing

(2) Mining detection (rule-based first, ML optional later)

(3) Illegal mining detection via shapefile overlay

(4) DEM depth + volume estimation

(5) 2D/3D visualization

(6) Report generation

Also provide suggestions for integrating this into a full-stack app (React frontend + FastAPI backend) later.
